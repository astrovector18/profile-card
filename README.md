## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt to apply custom fonts in css using the `@font-face` rule. 

```css
   @font-face {
	font-family: myFont;
	src: url("./assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf");
   }
```


### Continued development

I am definitely gonna consider using a css framework ( tailwindcss maybe) after
sharpening my css skills.
